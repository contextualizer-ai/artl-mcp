The rhizosphere exhibits remarkable chemical diversity, driven by an evolutionary arms race. Through these chemicals, plants shape the rhizosphere microbiome using different mechanisms: organic carbon provision, antimicrobial compound production, and exudation of microbiota recruitment signals. Modern high-input agriculture may have diminished the role of natural chemical interactions and modern crops may have lost some of the relevant traits. As our understanding of root-rhizosphere interactions grows, harnessing natural mechanisms for agricultural sustainability becomes increasingly viable, potentially helping agriculture to counteract growing challenges from environmental stresses, climate change, and rising input costs.","affiliation":"Plant Hormone Biology Group, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, 1098 XH Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Advantageous genetic diversity that allows adaptation to nutrient availability is present in historic crop genotypes. The Watkins collection of bread wheat landraces is an unexploited resource, carrying untapped phenotypic traits. Here, we show that the rhizosphere microbiome assembly of these landraces is distinct compared to elite varieties, specifically those that come from ancestral groups (AGs) not used in modern breeding. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to identify changes in microbial communities of rhizosphere soil collected from 81 landraces and two elite varieties. We found high similarity in microbiome recruitment between the elite cultivars and the two AGs genetically closest to the elite. The rhizosphere microbiome of five AGs genetically distant from the elite cultivars showed significant differences in the abundance of taxa involved in nitrogen and carbon turnover, keystone taxa and associations within the microbial network. Our findings suggest that genes to recruit or suppress microbial taxa in the rhizosphere are shared by landraces from these AGs. Selective breeding for traits to control microbial functions can enhance soil productivity and crop performance.","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Preprint"]},"bookOrReportDetails":{"publisher":"bioRxiv","yearOfPublication":2025},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Open

concept, involves complex interactions among plant roots, rhizospheric microbiota, and the soil environment that collectively safeguard plant health. Although extensively studied, the mechanisms driving rhizosphere immunity remain insufficiently elucidated. Rhizosphere microbes enhanced plant immunity through colonization, ISR/SAR induction, and interactions with root exudates and endophytes, triggering defense signals, producing antimicrobials, and modulating host metabolism. Organic and bioorganic fertilizers enhanced these effects by reshaping microbial communities, enriching beneficial taxa, and indirectly promoting resistance via improved nutrient cycling and soil health. Synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) have been developed to stabilize and enhance biocontrol. Four scalable SynComs design strategies have emerged: reductionist approaches for mechanistic insight, antagonistic combinations, core microbiome-based assemblies using keystone taxa, and resource competition to outcompete pathogens. Together, these approaches offer scalable solutions to construct stable and functional SynComs that enhance rhizosphere immunity. Future efforts should focus on translating rhizosphere immunity into agriculture by elucidating microbiome-plant-soil interactions and optimizing long-term soil management.","affiliation":"College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.","publicationStatus":"ppublish","language":"eng","pubModel":"Print-Electronic","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Review","Journal Article"]},"grantsList":{"grant":[{"grantId":"2022YFD1201600","agency":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"CQMAITS202303","agency":"Chongqing Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"CSTB2022TIAD-CUX0012","agency":"Chongqing Municipal Science and Technology Bureau","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"2022YFD1601404","agency":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"2023M742879","agency":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"2023CQBSHTB3132","agency":"Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Foundation","orderIn":0}]},"meshHeadingList":{"meshHeading":[{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Bacteria","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"CL","qualifierName":"classification","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"GE","qualifierName":"genetics","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"IM","qualifierName":"immunology","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"IP","qualifierName":"isolation & purification","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Plants","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"IM","qualifierName":"immunology","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"MI","qualifierName":"microbiology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Plant Roots","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"IM","qualifierName":"immunology","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"MI","qualifierName":"microbiology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Soil","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"CH","qualifierName":"chemistry","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Soil Microbiology"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Plant Diseases","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"IM","qualifierName":"immunology","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"MI","qualifierName":"microbiology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Plant Immunity"},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Rhizosphere"},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Microbiota"}]},"keywordList":{"keyword":["Plant diseases","Organic fertilizers","Rhizosphere Microbiome","Synthetic Microbial Communities (Syncoms)","Rhizosphere Immunity"]},"chemicalList":{"chemical":[{"name":"Soil","registryNumber":"0"}]},"subsetList":{"subset":[{"code":"IM","name":"Index Medicus"}]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5c02003"}]},"isOpenAccess":"N","inEPMC":"N","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"N","hasBook":"N","hasSuppl":"N","citedByCount":0,"hasData":"N","hasReferences":"Y","hasTextMinedTerms":"Y","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"Y","hasEvaluations":"N","authMan":"N","epmcAuthMan":"N","nihAuthMan":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCompletion":"2025-06-18","dateOfCreation":"2025-06-03","firstIndexDate":"2025-06-11","dateOfRevision":"2025-06-18","electronicPublicationDate":"2025-06-03","firstPublicationDate":"2025-06-03"},{"id":"40482721","source":"MED","pmid":"40482721","doi":"10.1016/j.plantsci.2025.112599","title":"Root architecture and the rhizosphere microbiome: Shaping sustainable agriculture.","authorString":"Araujo ASF, Pereira APA, de Medeiros EV, Mendes LW.","authorList":{"author":[{"fullName":"Araujo ASF","firstName":"Ademir S F","lastName":"Araujo","initials":"ASF","authorAffiliationDetailsList":{"authorAffiliation":[{"affiliation":"Soil Microbial Ecology Group, Centro de Ciências Agrárias, Universidade Federal do Piauí (UFPI), Teresina, PI, Brazil.

Historically, plant researchers have focused on above-ground traits to increase yield and reduce input dependence. However, below-ground traits, especially those related to the root system, are equally critical yet often overlooked due to phenotyping challenges. Root architecture, including some root traits, i.e., lateral root density, root hair abundance, and root tip number, plays central roles in plant establishment, stress tolerance, and the recruitment of beneficial microbes in the rhizosphere. Root exudates, a complex array of chemical compounds released by roots, vary with plant species, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. These compounds act as signals and nutrients, shaping the composition and function of rhizosphere microbial communities. In turn, the microbiome of rhizosphere contributes to plant health by facilitating nutrient uptake, enhancing stress resilience, and providing defense against pathogens. Integrating root traits into breeding programs offers promising opportunities to select for genotypes that are more efficient in recruiting beneficial microbes. Heritable root traits, such as increased branching, finer roots, and higher exudation capacity, can enhance microbiome assembly and stability. The assessment of genes can also regulate of these traits and represent targets for genomics-assisted selection. Some strategies, such as microbiome engineering, particularly through the design of synthetic microbial communities (SynComs), can be used to modulate root architecture and optimize plant-microbe interactions. Despite these promising outcomes, challenges remain in translating SynCom applications to the field due to environmental variability, native microbial competition, and limited understanding of host genetic controls. This review discusses how root architecture shapes the rhizosphere microbiome and explores strategies, such as trait-based breeding and microbiome engineering, for advancing sustainable crop production.","affiliation":"Soil Microbial Ecology Group, Centro de Ciências Agrárias, Universidade Federal do Piauí (UFPI), Teresina, PI, Brazil.

The recruitment of specific microbiomes helps mitigate stress, increases resistance to pathogens, and promotes plant growth, development, and reproduction. The structure of the rhizosphere microbiome is shaped by crop domestication and variations in ploidy levels. Here we list key genes that regulate rhizosphere microbiomes and host genetic traits. We also discuss the prospects for rigorous analysis of symbiotic interactions, research needs, and strategies for systematically utilizing microbe-crop interactions to improve crop performance. Finally, we highlight challenges of maintaining live rhizosphere microbiome collections and mining heritable variability to enhance interactions between host plants and their rhizosphere microbiomes.","affiliation":"Independent Researcher, Hyderabad, 500016, India.","publicationStatus":"aheadofprint","language":"eng","pubModel":"Print-Electronic","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Review","Journal Article"]},"keywordList":{"keyword":["Soil","Stress","Crops","Metagenomics","Gwas"]},"subsetList":{"subset":[{"code":"IM","name":"Index Medicus"}]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Open access","availabilityCode":"OA","documentStyle":"doi","site":"Unpaywall","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2025.04.004"},{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2025.04.004"}]},"isOpenAccess":"N","inEPMC":"N","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"N","hasBook":"N","hasSuppl":"N","citedByCount":0,"hasData":"N","hasReferences":"Y","hasTextMinedTerms":"Y","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"Y","license":"cc by","hasEvaluations":"N","authMan":"N","epmcAuthMan":"N","nihAuthMan":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCreation":"2025-05-07","firstIndexDate":"2025-05-08","dateOfRevision":"2025-05-07","electronicPublicationDate":"2025-05-06","firstPublicationDate":"2025-05-06"},{"id":"40635331","source":"MED","pmid":"40635331","pmcid":"PMC12241448","fullTextIdList":{"fullTextId":["PMC12241448"]},"doi":"10.1111/1758-2229.70155","title":"Farming System and Nematodes Affect the Rhizosphere Microbiome of Tropical Banana Plants.","authorString":"Colagiero M, Pocasangre L, Ciancio A, Pentimone I, Rosso LC.","authorList":{"author":[{"fullName":"Colagiero M","firstName":"Mariantonietta","lastName":"Colagiero","initials":"M","authorId":{"type":"ORCID","value":"0000-0002-2417-211X"},"authorAffiliationDetailsList":{"authorAffiliation":[{"affiliation":"Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Istituto per la Protezione Sostenibile Delle Piante, Bari, Italy."}]}},{"fullName":"Pocasangre L","firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Pocasangre","initials":"L","authorAffiliationDetailsList":{"authorAffiliation":[{"affiliation":"Escuela Agrícola Regional del Tropico Húmedo (EARTH), Limón, and Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza-CATIE, Turrialba, Costa Rica."}]}},{"fullName":"Ciancio A","firstName":"Aurelio","lastName":"Ciancio","initials":"A","authorId":{"type":"ORCID","value":"0000-0002-3886-2648"},"authorAffiliationDetailsList":{"authorAffiliation":[{"affiliation":"Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Istituto per la Protezione Sostenibile Delle Piante, Bari, Italy."}]}},{"fullName":"Pentimone I","firstName":"Isabella","lastName":"Pentimone","initials":"I","authorId":{"type":"ORCID","value":"0000-0003-4335-4071"},"authorAffiliationDetailsList":{"authorAffiliation":[{"affiliation":"Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Istituto per la Protezione Sostenibile Delle Piante, Bari, Italy."}]}},{"fullName":"Rosso LC","firstName":"Laura Cristina","lastName":"Rosso","initials":"LC","authorId":{"type":"ORCID","value":"0000-0001-5101-390X"},"authorAffiliationDetailsList":{"authorAffiliation":[{"affiliation":"Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Istituto per la Protezione Sostenibile Delle Piante, Bari, Italy."}]}}]},"authorIdList":{"authorId":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"0000-0001-5101-390X"},{"type":"ORCID","value":"0000-0002-2417-211X"},{"type":"ORCID","value":"0000-0002-3886-2648"},{"type":"ORCID","value":"0000-0003-4335-4071"}]},"dataLinksTagsList":{"dataLinkstag":["supporting_data"]},"journalInfo":{"issue":"4","volume":"17","journalIssueId":3967901,"dateOfPublication":"2025 Aug","monthOfPublication":8,"yearOfPublication":2025,"printPublicationDate":"2025-08-01","journal":{"title":"Environmental microbiology reports","medlineAbbreviation":"Environ Microbiol Rep","isoabbreviation":"Environ Microbiol Rep","nlmid":"101499207","issn":"1758-2229","essn":"1758-2229"}},"pubYear":"2025","pageInfo":"e70155","abstractText":"We studied the effects of farming systems and soil nematodes on the rhizosphere microbial profiles in three banana farming systems (conventional, barbecho and organic) compared with non-cultivated controls.

Plant-parasitic nematodes included Meloidogyne, Helicotylenchus, Radopholus, and other species. The banana cultivation and, to a minor extent, the field management type influenced the rhizosphere ASV and OTUs abundances, with a higher diversity found in organic versus conventional crops, with the organic control as the most biodiverse. Diversity indices showed differences for the total number of individuals (lowest in conventional banana) and rare species (highest in organic controls). Fungi differed for the highest species richness in the organic controls. Soil variables affecting microbial abundance included low Fe content and acidic pH. Nematodes were associated with microbial taxa that were specific to each herbivore species or feeding group, with omnivores/predators influencing microbial profiles mostly in the organic crop and controls. The organic management had the lowest impact on the diversity of belowground nematodes and rhizosphere microbiome, highlighting its beneficial potential in sustainable banana production and

crops such as tomato are highly susceptible to various pathogens. Nanoparticles (NPs) are emerging as effective nano-bactericides for managing plant pathogens. Communities of rhizosphere bacteria are essential for plant physiological health and also serve as a critical factor in evaluating the environmental compatibility of NPs. We evaluated the effects of a nano-bactericide (Cu-Ag nanoparticles) and a commercial bactericide (thiodiazole-copper) on the rhizosphere microbiome of tomato. The results show that low and high doses of the two bactericides induced alterations in the bacterial community structure to differing extents. Cu-Ag nanoparticles increased the relative abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria, including <i>Bacteroidota</i>, <i>Gemmatimonadota</i>, <i>Acidobacteriota</i>, and <i>Actinobacteriota.</i> Functional prediction revealed that Cu-Ag nanoparticles may affect the metabolic pathways of tomato root rhizosphere microorganisms and regulate the lacI/galR family, which controls virulence factors and bacterial metabolism. This study provides insight into the influence of metal nanoparticles on plant rhizosphere microbiomes and may lay a foundation for the application of nano-bactericides for the environmentally friendly control of plant diseases.","affiliation":"Agricultural Science College, Xichang University, Xichang 615000, China.","publicationStatus":"epublish","language":"eng","pubModel":"Electronic","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["research-article","Journal Article"]},"grantsList":{"grant":[{"grantId":"2024AQ2036","agency":"2024AQ2036","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"2024CX04","agency":"2024CX04","orderIn":0},{"grantId":"RCZ202505","agency":"RCZ202505","orderIn":0}]},"keywordList":{"keyword":["Tomato","Rhizosphere","Microbial community","Nanoparticles","Nano-bactericide"]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms13061327"},{"availability":"Open access","availabilityCode":"OA","documentStyle":"html","site":"Europe_PMC","url":"https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12195157"},{"availability":"Open access","availabilityCode":"OA","documentStyle":"pdf","site":"Europe_PMC","url":"https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12195157?pdf=render"}]},"isOpenAccess":"Y","inEPMC":"Y","inPMC":"Y","hasPDF":"Y","hasBook":"N","hasSuppl":"Y","citedByCount":0,"hasData":"Y","hasReferences":"Y","hasTextMinedTerms":"Y","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"N","license":"cc by","hasEvaluations":"N","authMan":"N","epmcAuthMan":"N","nihAuthMan":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCreation":"2025-06-27","firstIndexDate":"2025-06-28","fullTextReceivedDate":"2025-06-28","dateOfRevision":"2025-06-28","electronicPublicationDate":"2025-06-07","firstPublicationDate":"2025-06-07"},{"id":"IND609153732","source":"AGR","title":"Metagenomic and metabolomic profiling of rhizosphere microbiome adaptation to irrigation gradients in Camellia oil trees","authorString":"Lu K, Chen C, Zhou J, Yuan J, Lu M, Qiu J, Xiao Z, Tan X.","authorList":{"author":[{"fullName":"Lu K","firstName":"Kaizheng","lastName":"Lu","initials":"K"},{"fullName":"Chen C","firstName":"Chan","lastName":"Chen","initials":"C"},{"fullName":"Zhou J","firstName":"Junqin","lastName":"Zhou","initials":"J"},{"fullName":"Yuan J","firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yuan","initials":"J"},{"fullName":"Lu M","firstName":"Mengqi","lastName":"Lu","initials":"M"},{"fullName":"Qiu J","firstName":"Jiaqi","lastName":"Qiu","initials":"J"},{"fullName":"Xiao Z","firstName":"Zhun","lastName":"Xiao","initials":"Z"},{"fullName":"Tan X","firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Tan","initials":"X"}]},"journalInfo":{"volume":"232","journalIssueId":3969307,"dateOfPublication":"2025 Sep","monthOfPublication":9,"yearOfPublication":2025,"printPublicationDate":"2025-09-01","journal":{"title":"Industrial Crops & Products.","medlineAbbreviation":"Industrial crops and products.","issn":"0926-6690"}},"pubYear":"2025","pageInfo":"Not Available","abstractText":"The industrial cultivation of Camellia oil tree, a key woody oil species, has faced substantial challenges due to escalating extreme weather events in recent years. To investigate rhizosphere adaptations to irrigation regimes, three-year-old saplings were subjected to four evapotranspiration (ET)-based treatments: 50 % ET (I50), 75 % ET (I75), 100 % ET (I100), and natural rainfall (Control). Soil available nutrients (dissolved organic nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, available phosphorus) and enzyme activities (urease, phytase, acid phosphatase, β-glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase) were significantly lower under I100 than under I50. Metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic analyses revealed rhizosphere responses to these treatments. Shannon diversity index at phylum and genus levels were significantly higher in I50 and I75 than in I100. Relative abundances of Pseudomonadota, Acidobacteriota, Actinomycetota, and Bacteroidota increased in I50 and I75 but decreased in I100. Reduced irrigation elevated soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling gene abundance. Differentially abundant metabolites were predominantly enriched in amino acid biosynthesis pathways. Integrated analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between L-glutamate e and N/P cycling genes, alongside significant negative correlations with soil and leaf water content. In summary, under irrigation deficit, Camellia oil tree roots exhibited increased L-glutamate levels alongside enriched Acidobacteriota, Actinomycetota, Chloroflexota, and Planctomycetota, collectively enhancing soil N and P cycling. These findings advance irrigation strategy optimization for drought resilience and deepen understanding of plant-environment interactions in perennial crops.","language":"eng","pubModel":"Undetermined","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Journal Article"]},"isOpenAccess":"N","inEPMC":"N","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"N","hasBook":"N","hasSuppl":"N","citedByCount":0,"hasData":"N","hasReferences":"N","hasTextMinedTerms":"Y","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"N","hasEvaluations":"N","authMan":"N","epmcAuthMan":"N","nihAuthMan":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCompletion":"2025-05-30","dateOfCreation":"2025-05-30","firstIndexDate":"2025-07-03","firstPublicationDate":"2025-09-01"},{"id":"40554345","source":"MED","pmid":"40554345","doi":"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.138959","title":"Pseudomonas plecoglossicida inoculation reshapes rhizosphere microbiome for BDE-47 dissipation in the alfalfa rhizosphere.","authorString":"Qi X, Xu X, Xu C, Lv G, Cai J, Cheng Z, Yang Z, Yin H.","authorList":{"author":[{"fullName":"Qi X","firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Qi","initials":"X","authorAffiliationDetailsList":{"authorAffiliation":[{"affiliation":"College of Environmental Sciences, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}]}},{"fullName":"Xu X","firstName":"Xiaoxun","lastName":"Xu","initials":"X","authorAffiliationDetailsList":{"authorAffiliation":[{"affiliation":"College of Environmental Sciences, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.

In addition to the direct effects on plants and pollutants, the inoculant can induce changes in the rhizosphere microbiome; but its association with the dissipation of organic pollutants and the mechanisms underlying the rebuilding of rhizosphere microbiome remain unclear. Here, we study the effects of Pseudomonas plecoglossicida inoculation on BDE-47 elimination in the alfalfa rhizosphere, as well as the corresponding microbial response mechanisms. Microbial degradation in the rhizosphere, rather than plant extraction, was identified as the primary mechanism responsible for BDE-47 dissipation. Compared to the control without strain inoculation, BDE-47 concentration significantly decreased by 40.8 % with the strain inoculation in rhizosphere soil. The inoculate enriched populations of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Bacillus, and Lysobacter) known for their roles in promoting plant growth and degrading BDE-47. Furthermore, the inoculate markedly induced the production of root metabolites such as amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and terpenoids, which played a pivotal role in recruiting beneficial bacterial communities and enhancing the bioavailability of BDE-47. In conclusion, root metabolites and microbial inoculants collaboratively reshaped the rhizosphere microbiome, thereby supporting plant growth and enhancing the degradation of organic pollutants in the

been widely detected in soils due to their widespread production and utilization. However, their impacts on rhizosphere microbial consortia and plant metabolic adaptation mechanisms have been insufficiently characterized. Here, two typical BMPs, polybutylene adipate-<i>co</i>-terephthalate and polyhydroxybutyrate, were selected to assess the effects of individual and combined exposure on the rhizosphere and metabolomes of lettuce at different concentration levels (0.1 and 2%). Results revealed that both 2% BMPs inhibited lettuce growth. Similarly, 2 wt % BMPs also altered community structures. Several biomarkers, including <i>Bacillus</i> and <i>Streptomyces</i>, were identified for BMP exposure. The metabolomic analysis revealed that 2% BMPs significantly altered the root and leaf metabolomes of lettuce. Pathways and metabolites related to plant defense toward environmental stresses, like aucubin, bisnorbiotin, l-rhamnose, and niazimin, were also enriched after BMPs treatment. This study highlights the impact of BMPs on soil and plant health, improving our comprehension of their combined ecological impact on the soil environment.","affiliation":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecological Remediation, College of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China.","publicationStatus":"ppublish","language":"eng","pubModel":"Print-Electronic","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Journal Article"]},"meshHeadingList":{"meshHeading":[{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Bacteria","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"CL","qualifierName":"classification","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"DE","qualifierName":"drug effects","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"GE","qualifierName":"genetics","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"IP","qualifierName":"isolation & purification","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Plant Roots","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"GD","qualifierName":"growth & development","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"MI","qualifierName":"microbiology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Soil","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"CH","qualifierName":"chemistry","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Soil Pollutants","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"PD","qualifierName":"pharmacology","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"CH","qualifierName":"chemistry","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Soil Microbiology"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Biodegradation, Environmental"},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Metabolome","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"DE","qualifierName":"drug effects","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"N","descriptorName":"Rhizosphere"},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Microbiota","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"DE","qualifierName":"drug effects","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Biodegradable Plastics","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Microplastics","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"PD","qualifierName":"pharmacology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}},{"majorTopic_YN":"Y","descriptorName":"Lactuca","meshQualifierList":{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":"DE","qualifierName":"drug effects","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"GD","qualifierName":"growth & development","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"ME","qualifierName":"metabolism","majorTopic_YN":"N"},{"abbreviation":"MI","qualifierName":"microbiology","majorTopic_YN":"N"}]}}]},"keywordList":{"keyword":["Lettuce","Metabolomics","Biodegradable Microplastics","Rhizospheric Microbiota"]},"chemicalList":{"chemical":[{"name":"Soil Pollutants","registryNumber":"0"},{"name":"Soil","registryNumber":"0"},{"name":"Biodegradable Plastics","registryNumber":"0"},{"name":"Microplastics","registryNumber":"0"}]},"subsetList":{"subset":[{"code":"IM","name":"Index Medicus"}]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5c02160"}]},"isOpenAccess":"N","inEPMC":"N","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"N","hasBook":"N","hasSuppl":"N","citedByCount":0,"hasData":"N","hasReferences":"N","hasTextMinedTerms":"Y","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"N","hasEvaluations":"N","authMan":"N","epmcAuthMan":"N","nihAuthMan":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCompletion":"2025-06-18","dateOfCreation":"2025-06-06","firstIndexDate":"2025-06-11","dateOfRevision":"2025-06-18","electronicPublicationDate":"2025-06-06","firstPublicationDate":"2025-06-06"}]}}
